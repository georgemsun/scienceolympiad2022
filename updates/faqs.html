			<h3>How does a team qualify for the 2022 National Tournament?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Procedures for team qualification to the 2022 National Tournament are determined by each Science Olympiad state organization. Typically, the top team in each Division B and Division C at a state's designated state-level tournament will qualify for the 2022 National Tournament. Because the 2022 National Tournament has capacity for 60 teams in each division, some of the states with the highest number of team registrations by division may be offered up to two spots for teams to qualify.</p>

			<h3>What does the Satellite SO tournament format mean?</h3>
			<div>
				<p><a href="https://www.soinc.org/play/tournaments">Satellite SO</a> is a remote tournament format established by Science Olympiad to allow tournament participation during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this format, students compete at their school under the supervision of their coach(es). The 2022 National Tournament will take place on the <a href="https://scilympiad.com/sont2022">Scilympiad</a> platform. For full details, please see the <a href="/competition">Competition Day</a> page.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Why is the 2022 National Tournament in Satellite SO format?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.soinc.org/play/tournaments">Satellite SO</a> tournament format is intended for situations where conditions allow for students to be at school but might not allow for large public gatherings in a single location or travel to out-of-state events. Considering the varied impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on different communities nationwide, following a format where teams could compete remotely was determined to be the most inclusive and equitable.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Can teams travel to Caltech to compete in-person?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>The 2022 Science Olympiad National Tournament will not have any events hosted in-person at Caltech. Following the Satellite SO format, all students must compete at their schools under the supervision of their coach(es).</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Will medals and trophies be awarded?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Yes, medals and trophies will be awarded. The individuals and teams winning medals and trophies, respectively, will be recognized at the Awards Ceremony. After scores are finalized, medals and trophies will be mailed to the coach(es) or school of each team.</p>
