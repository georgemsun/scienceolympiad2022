		<p>Welcome to the <b>2022 Science Olympiad National Tournament</b>, hosted by <a href="https://caltech.edu">Caltech</a> with the support of <a href="https://soinc.org/">Science Olympiad</a>. This tournament represents the highest level of the science competition for middle and high schools across the nation, while also featuring Science Olympiad's Global Ambassador Team from Japan. That's more than 2,000 students participating in all!</p>
		<p>The running of the tournament is the culmination of the work of the hundreds of Caltech students, Southern California volunteers, and volunteers nationwide that have helped across the various tournaments Caltech has supported since Caltech Science Olympiad's inception in 2004. As the nation's first Science Olympiad alumni chapter, we at Caltech could not be prouder to bring the tournament to Pasadena, California, home to our campus and <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/legacy/awards-and-honors/nobel-laureates">6 Nobel laureate professors</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov">NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>.</p>
		<p>While the 2022 Science Olympiad National Tournament will be hosted virtually in consideration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we hope to put on an exciting experience that brings a piece of Caltech, Southern California, and Science Olympiad to wherever you are, regardless of whether your team is competing. From <a href="/festivities">livestreamed ceremonies</a> to fascinating <a href="/festivities#expo">STEM Expo events</a>, look forward to ways everyone can play during the week of May 9â€“14, 2022!</p>

		<p>This year's theme, <em>Imagination</em>, captures the spirit of invention and creativity in Caltech's home state of California. From NASA's <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-2020-perseverance-rover">Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Rover on Mars</a> to the innovative research at Caltech to the bright lights of Hollywood, imagination is in the air. Together, Science Olympiad and Caltech are working together to inspire the next generation of STEM superstars, makers and explorers.</p>

		<p>Caltech Science Olympiad seeks to continue its tradition of providing teams a high-quality and thought-provoking competition experience of the highest caliber in the country. Through our 2022 Science Olympiad National Tournament we hope competitors will not only be challenged but also, through experiencing some of life at Caltech, will feel encouraged and ready to use the skills and knowledge used in preparation for the tournament to be the leaders in science for the next generation.</p>

		<h2 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h2>
		<p>Science Olympiad tournaments are huge endeavors requiring intense time and materials that would not be possible without the generous support of sponsors. We give a heartfelt thanks to all of our sponsors, without whom running the 2022 Science Olympiad National Tournament would be impossible. It is through their commitment to advancing the next generation of scientists that Caltech and Science Olympiad can provide this premier competition experience.</p>
