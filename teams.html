		<h2 id="scoring">Scoring Process</h2>
		<p>At the conclusion of the Science Olympiad National Tournament Awards Ceremony on Wednesday, May 18, 2022, a copy of the final scores for the tournament will be posted to this page. A team's head coach has one hour from the end of the Awards Ceremony to submit compelling evidence of a scoring inconsistency using the Team Ranking Inquiry Form (to be shared the night of the 2022 National Tournament Awards Ceremony). If the evidence is verified, the appropriate points, medals and trophies will be awarded for that team only. Thinking that your team "did better" than scores reflect is not considered compelling evidence. Teams will not be asked to return awards or relinquish any points. Scores for the 2022 Science Olympiad National Tournament are not official until they are posted on the Science Olympiad website as Official Results. For more information about scoring please see Science Olympiad's <a href="https://www.soinc.org/join/policies">Policies</a> page.</p>
