		<h2 id="japan">Global Ambassador Team from Japan</h2>
		<p>In 2009, Board Members Dr. Gerard Putz and Jim Woodland traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to present Science Olympiad concepts to Japanese education officials from the Ministry of Education (MEXT) and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) at "Science Agora." A partnership between Science Olympiad and JST was born, founded on a shared passion for making science competition fun and exciting for all students. In March 2022, JST will host its 11th Annual Japan High School Science Championships (JHSSC), where the Grand Prize is a chance to participate in the 2022 Science Olympiad National Tournament presented in partnership with Caltech. As they did at the 2012–2021 National Tournaments, Japanese students will join their American peers online in tests, march in the virtual Parade of States and participate as unranked guests in selected Science Olympiad events.
